# TaskMaster  

TaskMaster is a to-do list app built using Vue.  
A user can see a list of their tasks, add new tasks, mark tasks complete, and delete tasks.  
I built TaskMaster to familiarize myself with Vue.  
TaskMaster uses json-server to simulate a REST API and vue router for client-side routing.
